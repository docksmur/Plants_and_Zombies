DESIGN CHOICES 



The coding up to now implements a functional GUI based version of Plants v Zombies, complete with

save/load and undo/redo features, as well as infinite restart functionality to make replaying the game easier.

The code uses an Observer model for the plants and zombies to communicate with eachother, the event 

source being the model class or GUI where the main function is, and where the grid that holds 

the listeners is made. The GUI utilizes the GridLayout class to create a grid of JButtons that

utilize the functionality from the previous text based version of the game. The undo and redo

features were done by keeping stacks of grid and sunpoints then delegating other changes to the

appropriate classes. This way it's class is responsible for changing itself back. The save and load

features were done using java serialization. This was done because it seemed like the easiest solution

and was relatively painless. To start the model class is serialized which causes all its feilds to be

serialized. An error occured when the view tried to serialize so the other observers were split off

so they could still be saved. The view can just be created from information in data any ways



CHANGES AND PLANS



Save and load were added to the model which handles saving everything by delegating to each class 

to serialize itself. A level editor was also created which is pretty much entirely seperate from the

actual game, sharing only Enemy and BigZombie as far as I can remember
