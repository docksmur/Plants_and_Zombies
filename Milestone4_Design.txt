DESIGN CHOICES 



The coding up to now implements a functional GUI based version of Plants v Zombies, complete with

save/load and undo/redo features, as well as infinite restart functionality to make replaying the game easier.

The code uses an Observer model for the plants and zombies to communicate with eachother, the event 

source being the model class or GUI where the main function is, and where the grid that holds 

the listeners is made. The GUI utilizes the GridLayout class to create a grid of JButtons that

utilize the functionality from the previous text based version of the game. The undo and redo

features were done by keeping stacks of grid and sunpoints then delegating other changes to the

appropriate classes. This way it's class is responsible for changing itself back.



CHANGES AND PLANS


A new subclass of Plant has been added, namely Potato Mine, which explodes and destroys the first zombie it comes into contact

with. A fully functional undo and redo feature has ben implemented into the GUI, including a restart feature

The future roadmap for the project will involve the addition of more types of plants and zombies, as well as the 

addition of Save/Load feature and a Level Builder mechanic.


The grid and sunpoints were seperated into it's own class. This was done to ease storage for

the undo and redo feature. Undo redo was implemented using a stack of grid + sunpoints. 

damage by plants from  the model class to the plant classes. All NPCs now also manage their 

locations to ease with damaging and stuff.
