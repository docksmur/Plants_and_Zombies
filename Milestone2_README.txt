README



This is the readme file for Milestone 2 of the Plant_and_Zombies programming project.
Included with this file are the final draft UML diagrams (Class and Sequence) for this second milestone, 
the Eclipse project files containing all the coding for this second milestone, as well as unit testing 
for PnZModel, and a file providing an explanation of design choices, class hierarchy and changes to the
code files and UML. This file will include some of the documentation on bugs noted in this draft of the 
code and an explanation of the user controls for the GUI implementation.



KNOWN BUGS

 

Pea Shooters placed behind the zombie still do damage to the zombie.
Implementing the GUI and the changes it made caused the text version to not work as it is. (probably could be fixed easily)




USER CONTROLS

	1. Run the main function in PnZView
	2. Click in the location you want to place a plant
	3. Choose what type of plant to add in the dialouge. CHOOSE WISELY CANNOT BE CHANGED!
	4. when satified with plant placements or out of money (that is a lot of plants) click start wave.
	5. continue adding plants and advancing the waves until you or the zombies win
