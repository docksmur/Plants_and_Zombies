README

This is the readme file for Milestone 2 of the Plant_and_Zombies programming project. 
Along with this file includes files that contain the final draft UML diagrams for this 
second milestone and the Eclipse project files containing all the coding for this second
milestone. This file will include some of the documentation deliverable elements, such as
an explanation of design choices and changes to the code files and UML, and an explanation
of the user controls.

KNOWN BUGS
 
Pea Shooters placed behind the zombie still do damage to the zombie.
Implementing the GUI and the changes it made caused the text version to not work as it is. (probably could be fixed easily)
